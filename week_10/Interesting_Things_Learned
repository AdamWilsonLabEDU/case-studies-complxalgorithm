In Case Study 10, I learned how to change legend labels of raster datasets (specifically, changing the numbers associated with each land cover type to full text descriptions). This is something that I applied to my project. I also learned how to take data from a raster and turn it into a time series line graph, which is not something I had been able to do with raster data before this case study.
